                <h1>Anomalies</h1>
                <h2>Funnel</h2>
                <p>
                    An anomaly of presumably gravitational nature.
                    At the moment of activation, with terrible force it draws into itself everything that is within a radius of 10-15 meters.
                    If you get into the center of the “funnel,” there is no chance of survival: the body of both the animal and the person will be compressed into a dense lump, and then torn apart at the moment of the so-called discharge.
                    During the entire period of existence - on average about a week - the anomaly does not change the place of its manifestation; can be visually detected during the day by the characteristic air movement above it, swirling foliage, fragments of dismembered corpses and a characteristic dark spot on the ground in the center.
                    It is extremely dangerous at night because it can only be detected by detectors or by throwing metal objects.

                <p>
                    In an inactive state, it looks like a barely visible cloud of hot air, but when any object or living creature enters the action zone, it forms a compact zone heated to a temperature of about 1500K.
                    At night it can only be detected by powerful detectors or by throwing metal objects.

                    Education is not completely clear nature.
                    It looks like a glowing bright green jelly, clearly visible in the dark.
                    Upon contact with the body, it causes injuries similar to the effects of strong acid.

                <h2>Electra</h2>
                <p>
                    An anomalous formation with a diameter of about 10 meters that accumulates static electricity.
                    A disturbed anomaly explodes with dozens of mini-lightning bolts, and electric shock is almost always fatal for any living creature.
                    A characteristic feature of the Electra is the bluish fog visible above it during the day.
                    At night it is easily detected by any kind of detectors or by throwing metal objects.

                <p>
                    Abnormal vegetation. When approached, it releases a cloud of particles that, upon contact with the human body, cause damage similar to the stinging cells of poisonous jellyfish.
                    Generates the Kolobok artifact around itself.
                    All artifacts of this anomaly, when worn on a belt, affect a person’s resistance to radiation due to the strong absorbent properties of down.

                    This anomaly was one of the first to be discovered back in 2008.
                    It causes impact damage with a gravitational field, similar to a shock wave from an explosion.
                    “Lives” in one place for an average week. Over the course of its life, the force of influence changes.
                    The force of impact ranges from bruises and contusions to instant death with the launch of the body into orbit.
                    It is detected by distortions in the air above it, swirling foliage, as well as characteristic red-brown spots on the ground that are the “starts” of losers and newbie dunces.
                    Its influence on a person can be slightly reduced by wearing the artifacts "Twist", "Gravity" and "Goldfish".
                    It is easily detected by all types of detectors and by throwing various metal objects at it.
