                <h1>Anomalies</h1>
                <h2>Funnel</h2>
                <p>An anomaly of presumably gravitational nature.
                    At the moment of activation, with terrible force it draws into itself everything that is within a radius of 10-15 meters.
                    If you get into the center of the “funnel,” there is no chance of survival: the body of both the animal and the person will be compressed into a dense lump, and then torn apart at the moment of the so-called discharge.
                    During the entire period of existence - on average about a week - the anomaly does not change the place of its manifestation; can be visually detected during the day by the characteristic air movement above it, swirling foliage, fragments of dismembered corpses and a characteristic dark spot on the ground in the center.
                    It is extremely dangerous at night because it can only be detected by detectors or by throwing metal objects. </p>

                <h2>Frying</h2>
                <p>In an inactive state, it looks like a barely visible cloud of hot air, but when any object or living creature enters the action zone, it forms a compact zone heated to a temperature of about 1500K.
                    At night it can only be detected by powerful detectors or by throwing metal objects.</p>

                <p>Education is not completely clear nature.
                    It looks like a glowing bright green jelly, clearly visible in the dark.
                    Upon contact with the body, it causes injuries similar to the effects of strong acid.</p>

                <h2>Electra</h2>
                <p>An anomalous formation with a diameter of about 10 meters that accumulates static electricity.
                    A disturbed anomaly explodes with dozens of mini-lightning bolts, and electric shock is almost always fatal for any living creature.
                    A characteristic feature of the Electra is the bluish fog visible above it during the day.
                    At night it is easily detected by any kind of detectors or by throwing metal objects.</p>

                    Abnormal vegetation. When approached, it releases a cloud of particles that, upon contact with the human body, cause damage similar to the stinging cells of poisonous jellyfish.
                    Generates the Kolobok artifact around itself.
                    All artifacts of this anomaly, when worn on a belt, affect a person’s resistance to radiation due to the strong absorbent properties of down.
